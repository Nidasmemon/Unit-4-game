# Unit-4-game

This is a guessing game where the computer generates a random number for you to match using jewels that also have random numbers assigned to them. Every time you click a jewel, your number increases by the amount set to that specific jewel. If you match the random number exactly, you win. However, if you go over, you lose. The game is then restarted for you to play again.  

Hope you enjoy playing Crystals Collector!
